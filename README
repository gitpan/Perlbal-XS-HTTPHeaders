Perlbal::XS::HTTPHeaders
========================

This module is a parser for HTTP headers, written in C++.  It uses classes
internally to provide a fast and easy to use interface to parsing,
creating, and working with HTTP headers.

This module is designed for use in Perlbal, a software HTTP load balancer
by Danga Interactive.

In order to use this module, you will need the Perl development libraries
along with a C++ compiler and some random assorted things that convert XS
files into C (etc).  (Not sure if this is part of the Perl development
libraries or not... but it should be pretty standard.)


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Alternately, if you're on Debian...

   dh-make-perl --build
   dpkg -i ../libperlbal-xs-httpheaders<TAB>

Once you have the files installed, you can instruct Perlbal to use them
by typing 'xs enable headers' in a management console (or putting that in
your configuration file).  Note you will have to restart Perlbal after the
module is installed in order for it to notice they exist.


DEPENDENCIES

Don't think there are any dependencies for this module.
